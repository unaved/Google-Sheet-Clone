**Google Sheets Clone â€“ Web-Based Spreadsheet Application**
This project is a Google Sheets-inspired web application built using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. It provides a user-friendly spreadsheet interface with essential mathematical functions, data quality tools, and intuitive UI interactions, mimicking key features of Google Sheets.

**Key Features:**
âœ… Spreadsheet Interface â€“ A familiar grid layout with a toolbar, formula bar, and support for cell formatting (bold, italics, font size, color).
âœ… Drag & Drop Support â€“ Users can drag content, formulas, and selections similar to Google Sheets.
âœ… Cell Dependencies â€“ Automatic formula updates based on dependent cells.
âœ… Mathematical Functions â€“ Built-in support for SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, and COUNT.
âœ… Data Quality Tools â€“ Functions like TRIM, UPPER, LOWER, REMOVE_DUPLICATES, and FIND_AND_REPLACE.
âœ… Data Entry & Validation â€“ Supports text, numbers, and dates with validation checks.
âœ… Testing Functionality â€“ Users can test functions and view results dynamically.

**Bonus Features (Optional Enhancements):**
ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Formulas â€“ Support for complex expressions, absolute/relative references.
ðŸ“Š Data Visualization â€“ Chart and graph integration for better insights.
ðŸ’¾ Save & Load â€“ Users can persist and retrieve spreadsheet data.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
UI & UX Fidelity â€“ How closely the interface matches Google Sheets.
Functionality & Accuracy â€“ Correctness of calculations and data handling.
Code Quality â€“ Well-structured, maintainable, and scalable implementation.
Usability & Testing â€“ Clear results and an intuitive experience for users.
Tech Stack & Design Choices:
Backend: Spring Boot (REST API, data processing)
Frontend: Thymeleaf (dynamic rendering)
Database: MySQL (data storage for saved sheets)
Libraries: JavaScript (UI interactions), jQuery/AJAX (enhanced responsiveness)
This project ensures a seamless spreadsheet experience with real-time updates and essential data operations, making it an efficient alternative to Google Sheets for basic spreadsheet tasks. ðŸš€
