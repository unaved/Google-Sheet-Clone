Features:
1. Spreadsheet Interface:
○ Mimic Google Sheets UI: Strive for a visual design and layout that
closely resembles Google Sheets, including the toolbar, formula bar, and
cell structure.
○ Drag Functions: Implement drag functionality for cell content, formulas,
and selections to mirror Google Sheets' behavior.
○ Cell Dependencies: Ensure that formulas and functions accurately reflect
cell dependencies and update accordingly when changes are made to
related cells.
○ Support for basic cell formatting (bold, italics, font size, color).
○ Ability to add, delete, and resize rows and columns.
2. Mathematical Functions:
○ Implement the following mathematical functions:
1. SUM: Calculates the sum of a range of cells.
2. AVERAGE: Calculates the average of a range of cells.
3. MAX: Returns the maximum value from a range of cells.
4. MIN: Returns the minimum value from a range of cells.
5. COUNT: Counts the number of cells containing numerical values in a
range.
3. Data Quality Functions:
○ Implement the following data quality functions:
1. TRIM: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a cell.
2. UPPER: Converts the text in a cell to uppercase.
3. LOWER: Converts the text in a cell to lowercase.
4. REMOVE_DUPLICATES: Removes duplicate rows from a selected
range.
5. FIND_AND_REPLACE: Allows users to find and replace specific text
within a range of cells.
4. Data Entry and Validation:
○ Allow users to input various data types (numbers, text, dates).
○ Implement basic data validation checks (e.g., ensuring numeric cells only
contain numbers).
5. Testing:
○ Provide a means for users to test the implemented functions with their
own data.
○ Display the results of function execution clearly.
